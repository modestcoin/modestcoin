What is Modestcoin?
----------------

Modestcoin is an experimental digital currency forked from litecoin, that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Modestcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Modestcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Modestcoin Core software, see [https://modestcoin.org](https://modestcoin.org).

Modestcoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/modestcoin-project/modestcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Modestcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/modestcoin-dev)
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #modestcoin-dev.

Testing
-------

Testing and building is highly encouraged as it helps the development of Modestcoin.
