What is Modestcoin?
----------------

Modestcoin is an experimental digital currency hard-forked from litecoin, that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Modestcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Modestcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Modestcoin Core software, see [https://modestcoin.org](https://modestcoin.org).

Custom RPC Ports, New Genesis Block, New Total Supply, New Block Rewards, Rebranding/Renaming
-------
Modestcoin uses custom RPC Ports (6333) to ensure its seperated from Bitcoin and other altcoins.
The developers at modestcoin generated a new genesis block (1st block) to verify transactions off of.
Our team also made it so all modestcoin addresses start with the letter M, 
There is 16 Million Total Supply, instead of 21 million like bitcoin or 84 million like litecoin.
The new reward per block mined is 40 MTC,
Testing and building modestcoin is highly encouraged as it helps the development of Modestcoin.
